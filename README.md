Ever feel like you need a tiny, unobtrusive sticky note for your stocks on T212? I built this because I kept forgetting what I wanted to do with a stock‚Äîwas it a long-term hold? A quick trade? I needed a note right where I could see it, in the same place I make my moves. So here it is! A simple tool for a very real problem.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Hover Notes**: Add custom notes that appear instantly when you hover over a stock ticker.
* **Custom Colors**: Personalize your notes with custom text and background colors.
